# Scalajutsu's String Template Mojo

This is a Maven mojo that executes in the generate and/or generate-sources phase,
it process StringTemplate files using parameters passed by hand
or from a Database query.

It was created to cover the need of generating Scala code but it should be possible to use it
for other purposes.
